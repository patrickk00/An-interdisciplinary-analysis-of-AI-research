Artificial intelligence is becoming more and more crucial in everyday life, with significant investments
leading to substantial advancements and outcomes. In order to deeply understand this field, it is important
to analyze how scientific papers discussing AI have transformed over time as well as understand the
authorâ€™s net that wrote about it.
To achieve this, we collected almost fifteen thousand papers from arxiv, categorized them based on
academic disciplines like computer science, chemistry, physics, finance and so on. Furthermore we
arranged them by year periods that was more relevant. We then created customized models using
different techniques for each subgroup to conduct an in-depth semantic analysis of the most relevant
words related to AI.
Besides, we carried out a collaborators finder to determine the degree of content similarity among
different authors with the goal to detect authors that might collaborate together in future. Furthermore,
we utilized the BERT model to retrieve relevant papers through sentence-based queries.
Our study employed various methodologies, including constructing yearly and academic category slices,
developing models for specific cases, conducting similarity analysis, utilizing BERT for paper retrieval, and
employing CADE analysis across years and categories. Ultimately, our research aims to illuminate the
evolution of AI terminology and concepts also trough a SWEAT analysis.
